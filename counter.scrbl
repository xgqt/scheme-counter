@section{About}


@subsection{The library}

@defmodule[counter]

@racketmodname[counter] is a very simple library providing two functions
for creating closures: @racket[make-meter] & @racket[make-counter].

Those functions can be utilized for logging,
for debugging output of console applications
or just counting iteration times of some other functions.

The core library is written in pure scheme and can be utilized by
probably most scheme implamentations.

Know limitations are that the counter can only count up.
To have a more freeform way use structs, objects, @racket[make-parameter]
or just utilize @racket[set!].


@subsection{Upstream}

The upstream repository can be found on
@link["https://gitlab.com/xgqt/scheme-counter" "GitLab"].


@subsection{License}

Counter is available in Public Domain or under the CC0 License.


@section{Alternative}

As described previously a simple @racket[set!] can be used
to manage "counters" in a similar fashion.

@racketblock[
          (define c 0)
          (set! c (+ c 1))
          c
          1
          (set! c (+ c 1))
          c
          2
          ]

With @racketmodname[counter] similar code would look like:

@racketblock[
          (define c (make-counter 0))
          (c 1)
          1
          (c 0)
          1
          (c 1)
          2
          (c 0)
          2
          ]

Benefits of using @racket[make-counter] over @racket[set!] are less code
(which is more DRY).
Also the number of times the growth-procedure is ran can be specified.
If the number of runs is zero or less only the value of the counter
is returned.
